\arguments{
\item{pref}{Prefix of \emph{(packed)ancestrymap} or \emph{PLINK} files. \emph{(packed)ancestrymap} has to end in \code{.geno}, \code{.snp}, \code{.ind},
PLINK has to end in \code{.bed}, \code{.bim}, \code{.fam}}

\item{outdir}{Directory where data will be stored. If \code{NULL}, data will be returned instead of written to disk.}

\item{inds}{Individuals for which data should be extracted}

\item{pops}{Populations for which data should be extracted. If both \code{pops} and \code{inds} are provided, they should have the same length and will be matched by position. If only \code{pops} is provided, all individuals from the \code{.ind} or \code{.fam} file in those populations will be extracted. If only \code{inds} is provided, each indivdual will be assigned to its own population of the same name. If neither \code{pops} nor \code{inds} is provided, all individuals and populations in the \code{.ind} or \code{.fam} file will be extracted.}

\item{cols_per_chunk}{Number of populations per chunk. Lowering this number will lower the memory requirements when running \code{\link{write_split_f2_block}}, but more chunk pairs will have to be computed.}

\item{numparts}{Number of parts in which genotype data will be read for computing allele frequencies}

\item{maxmiss}{Discard SNPs which are missing in a fraction of populations higher than \code{maxmiss}}

\item{minmaf}{Discard SNPs with minor allele frequency less than \code{minmaf}}

\item{maxmaf}{Discard SNPs with minor allele frequency greater than than \code{maxmaf}}

\item{outpop}{Keep only SNPs which are heterozygous in this population}

\item{auto_only}{Keep only SNPs on chromosomes 1 to 22}

\item{transitions}{Set this to \code{FALSE} to exclude transition SNPs}

\item{transversions}{Set this to \code{FALSE} to exclude transversion SNPs}

\item{keepsnps}{SNP IDs of SNPs to keep. Overrides other SNP filtering options}

\item{format}{Supply this if the prefix can refer to genotype data in different formats
and you want to choose which one to read. Should be \code{plink} to read \code{.bed}, \code{.bim}, \code{.fam} files, or \code{ancestrymap}, or \code{packedancestrymap} to read \code{.geno}, \code{.snp}, \code{.ind} files.}

\item{adjust_pseudohaploid}{Genotypes of pseudohaploid samples are usually coded as \code{0} or \code{2}, even though only one allele is observed. \code{adjust_pseudohaploid} ensures that the observed allele count increases only by \code{1} for each pseudohaploid sample. If \code{TRUE} (default), samples that don't have any genotypes coded as \code{1} among the first 1000 SNPs are automatically identified as pseudohaploid. This leads to slightly more accurate estimates of f-statistics. Setting this parameter to \code{FALSE} is equivalent to the \emph{ADMIXTOOLS} \code{inbreed: NO} option.}

\item{verbose}{Print progress updates}
}
\value{

\description{
Prepare data for various \emph{ADMIXTOOLS 2} functions. Reads data from packedancestrymap or PLINK files,
and computes allele frequencies for selected populations and stores it as \code{.rds} files in outdir.
