\title{Estimate admixture weights}
\usage{
qpadm(f2_data, target = NULL, left = NULL, right = NULL,
  wave = TRUE, fudge = 1e-04, boot = FALSE, getcov = TRUE,
  constrained = FALSE, cpp = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{f2_data}{a 3d array of blocked f2 statistics, output of \code{\link{f2_from_precomp}}. Alternatively, a directory with f2 statistics.}

\item{target}{Target population}

\item{left}{Source populations}

\item{right}{Outgroup populations}

\item{wave}{If \code{TRUE} (the default), lower rank models and models with fewer source populations will also be tested.}

\item{fudge}{value added to diagonal matrix elements before inverting}

\item{boot}{If \code{FALSE} (the default), each block will be left out at a time and the covariance matrix
of f4 statistics, as well as the weight standard errors, will be computed using block-jackknife.
Otherwise bootstrap resampling is performed \code{n} times, where \code{n} is either equal to \code{boot} if it is an integer,
or equal to the number of blocks if \code{boot} is \code{TRUE}. The the covariance matrix of f4 statistics,
as well as the weight standard errors, will be computed using bootstrapping.}

\item{getcov}{Return standard errors for weights? Setting this to \code{FALSE} makes this function much faster.}

\item{constrained}{Constrain admixture weights to be non-negative}

\item{cpp}{Use C++ functions. Setting this to \code{FALSE} will be slower but can help with debugging.}

\item{verbose}{Print progress updates}
}
\value{
A list with output describing the model fit:
\enumerate{
\item \code{weights} a data frame with estimated admixture proportions where each row is left population.
estimated edge length, and for admixture edges, it is the estimated admixture weight.
\item \code{rankdrop} a data frame describing model fits with different ranks, including p-values for the overall fit
and for nested models (comparing two models with rank difference of one). returned only if \code{wave = TRUE}
\item \code{popdrop} a data frame describing model fits with different populations. returned only if \code{wave = TRUE}
}
}
\description{
Models target as a mixture of left populations, given a set of outgroup right populations.
Can be used to estimate admixture proportions, and to estimate the number of independent
admixture events (see \code{wave}).
