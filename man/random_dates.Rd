\title{Get random dates for graph nodes}
\usage{
random_dates(graph, min = 1000, max = 1000, fix = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An admixture graph}

\item{min}{Lower and upper limit of uniform distribution}

\item{max}{Upper limit of uniform distribution}

\item{fix}{Boolean specifying if leaf nodes will be fixed to 0. If \code{TRUE} (default), all samples will be drawn at the end of the simulation (i.e., from today).}
}
\value{
A named vector with random dates for each graph node
}
\description{
This function assigns a date to each node in an admixture graph and is used in \code{\link{random_sim}}. The dates will drawn from a uniform distribution with given lower and upper bounds,
unless \code{fix} option is set \code{TRUE}, in which case all leaf nodes returned by \code{\link{get_leafnames()}} will be set to 0.
