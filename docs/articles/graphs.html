<p><strong>Under construction</strong></p>
<p>Admixture graphs are models of the demographic history of a set of individuals or populations. Genetic data, in particular <em>f</em>-statistics, are informative about the topology (the shape) and the parameters (drift and admixture weights) of a graph, which allows us to favor some models and to reject others.</p>
<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> makes it easy to work with admixture graphs. It allows you to read and write them in a number of different formats, create them from scratch, and modify them in a number of ways.</p>
<p><code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code> evaluates a single graph by finding the best combination of weights for a specific topology. <code><a href="../reference/find_graphs.html">find_graphs()</a></code> tries to find the best fitting graph topologies for a set of <em>f</em>-statistics.</p>
<p>In addition to that there are a number of functions for exploring the topological neighborhood of a graph, to test whether the fits of two graphs are significantly different from one another, and to simulate data under any admixture graph.</p>

<p>Single <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics and <em>D</em>-statistics tell us what an admixture graph for four populations could look like. Letâ€™s say we have four populations with these <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>- or <em>D</em>-statistics (all other possible <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics can be computed from these two, which is why they are not also listed here):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_4(A,B; C,D) = 0\]</span> <span class="math display">\[f_4(A,C; B,D) = 0.1\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_4(A,B; C,D) = 0\)</span> suggests that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> form a clade relative to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, and a significantly positive value for <span class="math inline">\(f_4(A,C; B,D)\)</span> suggests that there is some amount of genetic drift shared between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> that is not shared by <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> (If <span class="math inline">\(f_4(A,C; B,D)\)</span> were also zero, it would suggest a star phylogeny). The admixture graph connecting the four populations could therefore look like this:</p>

<p>In any admixture graph, <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> of two populations is simply the sum of all path lengths that lie between the populations. For example, in the two graphs above, <span class="math inline">\(f_2(C, D) = n2|C + n2|D\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(n2|C\)</span> is the edge going from <span class="math inline">\(n2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>More generally, an admixture graph can be described by a set of equations which relate edges of the graph to <em>f</em>-statistics. There are <span class="math inline">\(\frac{k(k-1)}{2}\)</span> equations for the <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics of all population pairs (<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the number of populations):</p>

<p>These equations tell us that the expected <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics for each pair is the sum of all edges that separate these two populations. In graphs with admixture, some population pairs will be connected through two or more paths. For those population pairs the expected <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> will be a weighted sum of all paths connecting the two populations, with the weights given by the relative ancestry proportions.</p>

graph above illustrates nicely how the <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-ratio test can be used to estimate admixture weights. This test estimates an admixture weight <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> as the ratio of two <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics, in this case <span class="math inline">\(a = \frac{f_4(O,B;C,A)}{f_4(O,B;C,D)}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(f_4(O,B;C,D)\)</span> is exactly equal to the distance between <span class="math inline">\(n1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n2\)</span>, the left blue edge. Thatâ€™s because <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> form a clade relative to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, and this edge is the only connection between the two clades. (They are not clades in the usual sense of the word, but in the sense that there is no overlap between the paths from <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and the paths from <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>.) At the same time, <span class="math inline">\(f_4(O,B;C,A)\)</span> is the intersection of paths going from <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and from <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Now there are two paths going from <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>: A short one through the left, and a long one through the right admixture edge. Along the short path going to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> from the left, there is no intersection with the path from <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, so the component of <span class="math inline">\(f_4(O,B;C,A)\)</span> going through that path is zero. This means that all if <span class="math inline">\(f_4(O,B;C,A)\)</span> is not equal to zero, it is only due to the long path from <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Along that path, the intersection with <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is exactly the left blue edge again. We now have two expressions for the length of that path: The first expression is <span class="math inline">\(f_4(O,B;C,D)\)</span>, and the second expression is <span class="math inline">\(a \times f_4(O,B;C,A)\)</span>, and so we can estimate <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{f_4(O,B;C,A)}{f_4(O,B;C,D)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For more complex graphs, drift lengths and admixture weights can be estimated in just the same way, although it is not always possible to express each estimated parameter as a simple ratio of two <em>f</em>-statistics. However, even without such simple expression, it is usually possible estimate graph parameters by numerically finding solutions to the system of graph equations. <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code> is doing just that: It finds the drift and admixture weights for a given graph which minimize the squared difference between the observed and the expected <em>f</em>-statistics.</p>

<div id="why-f3" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#why-f3" class="anchor"></a>Why f3?</h3>
<p>(See also <a href="graphs.html#fitting-a-single-admixture-graph-1">this section</a>)</p>
<p><code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code> uses <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>- rather than <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics for modeling graphs. <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>- and <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics are just sums of <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics, in particular</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_3(A; B, C) = \frac{1}{2} (f_2(A,B)+f_2(A,C)-f_2(B,C))\]</span></p>
<p>This raises the question whether it makes a difference to express a graph in terms of equations for <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics or equations for <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics. If there is an exact solution for one of the (<span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>) equation system, it is also a solution for the other equation system. In a case like that, the choice of <em>f</em>-statistics used does not make a difference.</p>
<p>In practice, however, there usually is no exact solution for a given graph and set of <em>f</em>-statistics. Instead, <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code> estimates weights which minimize the sum of squared differences between the expected and the observed <em>f</em>-statistics, and this difference is usually greater than zero. In that case, an equation system of <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics can lead to different weight estimates than an equation system of <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics. In particular, using <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics will give more importance to the internal edges of the admixture graph, rather than the terminal edges leading to the leaf nodes. Thatâ€™s because each <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistic can be thought of as the distance between two leaf nodes, while most <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics (all except the ones of the form <span class="math inline">\(f_3(A; B, B)\)</span>) can be thought of as the distance between one leaf node (ideally an outgroup) and some internal node (the split point of the other two populations, in the simplest case without admixture).</p>

<div id="identifiability" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#identifiability" class="anchor"></a>Identifiability</h3>
<p>Each admixture graph can be described by an equation system which relates drift and admixture weights to <em>f</em>-statistics. This equation system may be unidentifiable, which means it is not possible to estimate all the weights at the same time. (In practice we will still get estimates for unidentifiable weights because of the regularization terms, but these estimates are often completely arbitrary.)</p>
<p>Consider the following graph, which differs from the earlier graph only in that population <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is missing:</p>

In contrast to the similar example from before, we now have no <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistic which can be interpreted as the length of an internal edge, because in this graph, no

<p>In this graph, all of the drift lengths and admixture weights are unidentifiable.</p>
<p>To see what this means in practice, we simulate data under this admixture graph, and the test whether we can recover the correct parameters:</p>
<p>Not providing any additional simulation parameters will default to all drift edges being of equal length (except the one going to the outgroup), and all admixture nodes to be in 50/50 proportions.</p>

the estimated admixture weights are very far from the simulated 50/50 proportions. If we ran similar simulations for the graph from before which includes a fifth population <em>E</em>, so that all edges are identifiable, we would see that the admixture proportion estimates are not affected by changing the date of any node.</p>

patterns in here are very common:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The two edges connected root are not identifiable. We can estimate how much drift has occurred on these two edges in combination, but it is not possible to attribute it to either of the two edges. The penalization terms that are used during the fitting of admixture graphs will ensure that both edges are always estimated to be of the same length.</p></li>
<li><p>The drift edges directly adjacent to a admixture edge can not all be estimated at the same time.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If a graph has non-identifiable edges, it means that the estimated values for those edges should be treated with caution. However, the graph itself can still be a valid model. In particular, the fit of the graph (likelihood score or worst residual) will not be meaningfully affected by the presence of non-identifiable edges.</p>
<p>Even if all edges in a graph are identifiable, some estimated parameters may not be robust, for example if they rely on precise estimates of short edges in the graph. In this case, <a href="graphs.html#bootstrap-resampled-graph-fits-1">bootstrap confidence intervals</a> can be used to find out how robust the parameter estimates are.</p>

<a href="#f-statistics-vs-sfs" class="anchor"></a>f-statistics vs SFS</h3>
<p><em>f</em>-statistics only use a subset of the information contained in genetic data. They reduce the data to a single estimate of genetic distance for each population pair. Additional information relevant for demographic history which is <em>not</em> utilized by <em>f</em>-statistics includes the joint distribution of allele counts across populations (joint site frequency spectrum, SFS), and patterns of linkage disequilibrium.</p>
<p>Methods based on the joint site frequency spectrum have the advantage that they can distinguish some models which cannot be distinguished using <em>f</em>-statistics alone. At the same time, the greater complexity of SFS based methods makes them slower and less robust.</p>
<p>Drift and admixture weights are the only parameters for modeling admixture graphs using <em>f</em>-statistics. In contrast, SFS-based methods break genetic drift apart into components for effective population size, time, and mutation rate. This makes them more powerful, but also less robust.</p>
<p>The following three graphs cannot be distinguished using only <em>f</em>-statistics:</p>

<p>For any set of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>-statistics, the fit of one of these graphs is the same as the fit of the other two. With site frequency spectra, these models would result in different fits and could possibly be distinguished. (However, even with perfect data, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580908000038?casa_token=FYR8i8ICeB4AAAAA:oDtrv_MIgl-Vxys3LYBr0AdpebGbZMjALDWjjy7DqIuQtFSgBYitOY3ww_81awP3YvTelkX_">not all possible demographic histories can be distinguished using site frequency spectra</a>)</p>
<p>On the other hand, this example shows that even though admixture graphs have only pulse admixture events and no continues admixture or split events, the fit of these highly discretized models using <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>-statistics is identical to the fits of a much larger class of models with continuous admixture and population splits. Basically, every internal node can be thought of as a stand-in for an arbitrarily complex relationship among its three adjacent edges.</p>

<a href="#graphs-in-admixtools-2" class="anchor"></a>Graphs in <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>
</h2>
<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> can read and write graphs in a number of different formats, including the format used by the original <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> software and DOT format, but internally it uses only the following two representations of admixture graphs:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>An edge list</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This is either a matrix or a data frame where each edge is in a different row. The first column (<code>from</code>) contains the names of the source nodes, and the second column (<code>to</code>) contains the names of the target nodes. No distinction is made between admixture edges and drift edges, or between different types of nodes. Optionally, there are two more columns (<code>lower</code> and <code>upper</code>), which put constraints on the length of an edge. For admixture edges, these constraints should be between 0 and 1, and for drift edges they can range from 0 to infinity. No constraints are indicated by <code>NA</code>.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>An <code>igraph</code> graph object</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This format is used for most operations that modify graphs, since the <a href="https://igraph.org/r/">igraph package</a> provides many useful functions for working with graphs. If not otherwise specified, functions that take graphs as input expect a graph in this format.</li>
</ul>
<p>To convert an admixture graph from one of these representations to the other, you can use the <code>igraph</code> function <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/igraph/man/graph_from_edgelist.html">igraph::graph_from_edgelist()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/igraph/man/as_edgelist.html">igraph::as_edgelist()</a></code>.</p>
<div id="valid-graphs" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#valid-graphs" class="anchor"></a>Valid graphs</h3>
<p>A valid admixture graph in <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> has to satisfy a number of conditions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It has to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed, acyclic graph</a>
</li>
<li>All nodes have to be connected and there canâ€™t be any duplicated edges</li>
<li>No node should have more than two incoming or outgoing edges</li>
<li>Every population for which we have data should be a terminal node with only one incoming edge</li>
</ol>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/is_valid.html">is_valid()</a></code> tests whether a graph satisfies these conditions.</p>
<p>The third condition prohibits so-called multifurcations, or politomies. The function <code><a href="../reference/split_multifurcations.html">split_multifurcations()</a></code> turns a graph with multifurcations into a graph without multifurcations. At the same time, it constrains the newly introduced edges to be near zero, so that while fitting the graph, the multifurcations will be respected.</p>
<p>The last condition ensures that each observed population can have drift which is shared with no other population. This means that no observed population is a direct ancestor of any other population, and it is the reason why random error in the genotypes of any population does not lead to bias.</p>

<a href="#creating-and-loading-admixture-graphs" class="anchor"></a>Creating and loading admixture graphs</h3>
<p>The examples above have already demonstrated how admixture graphs can be created from scratch in R: By creating a two column matrix where each row represents and edge, with the first column the origin, and the second column the destination.</p>
<p>You can also generate random graphs with your choice of population labels and a set number of admixture events:</p>

<p><code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code> tries to find the admixture- and drift-edge weights for a given graph topology which are most consistent with the observed <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>-statistics. It takes a <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>-statistics and a graph as input, and returns the best likelihood score it could find, as well as the corresponding weights.</p>
<div id="initial-weights" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#initial-weights" class="anchor"></a>Initial weights</h3>
<p>The optimization of admixture weights requires initial values for the weights. Occasionally, the initial values have an effect on the final weight estimates because the optimization gets stuck in a local optimum. To avoid this, the <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code> weight optimization is repeated with different randomly chosen combinations of starting weights, and the final likelihood score represents the best score out of all tries. By default, 10 different random combinations of starting weights are evaluated. Decreasing this number can speed up <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code>, and increasing it can reduce the risk of missing the global optimum.</p>
<p>To get a better sense of how stable the edge weight optimization is, it makes sense to inspect the <code>opt</code> output of <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code>. This data frame contains all random initial weight combinations, as well as the optimized weights, final scores (<code>value</code>) and additional information about the optimization generated by the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/optim.html">optim()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>In this example, the optimization is very stable, and the initial values do not affect the estimated weights (columns <code>p1</code> to <code>p3</code>) or the score (column <code>value</code>):</p>

<!-- ### Precomputed $f_3$-statistics -->
<!-- The first steps in `qpgraph()` are computing $f_3$-statistics from $f_2$-statistics, and computing the inverse of the $f_3$-statistic covariance matrix. When many graphs are evaluated for the same populations, it can be faster to run these steps only once and pass $f_3$-statistics and the inverse of the covariance matrix to the `qpgraph()` function. That is the purpose of the `f3precomp` and `ppinv` arguments. The `f3precomp` argument expects a list with $f_3$-statistics and the inverse of the covariance matrix. It is used for example in `find_graphs()`. -->
<!-- The `ppinv` argument expects only the inverse of the covariance matrix, while $f_3$-statistics will be computed inside `qpgraph()`. This is used in `qpgraph_resample_multi()` to use an inverse covariance matrix computed on a different set of SNPs. -->

<div id="regularization-terms" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#regularization-terms" class="anchor"></a>Regularization terms</h3>
<p>There are two regularization terms used in <em>qpGraph</em>, which make matrix inversions more stable.</p>
<p>One is called <code>diag</code> and is added to the covariance matrix of fitted branch lengths (after multiplying it by the mean of the diagonal elements). It is the same as the <code>diag</code> parameter in the original <em>qpGraph</em> program and defaults to 10<sup>-4</sup>. Increasing <code>diag</code> will shift the likelihood scores to be <em>further away from zero</em>. This regularization term ensures that edge weights will be evenly distributed across a set of edges whose weights could otherwise not be determined unambiguously. (As is often the case with the two edges originating in the root node.)</p>
<p>The other regularization term is added to the diagonal elements of the <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span> covariance matrix (after multiplying it by the mean of the diagonal elements). It is called <code>diag_f3</code> and defaults to 10<sup>-5</sup>. In the original <em>qpGraph</em> program it is fixed at that value. Increasing this factor has a small effect on admixture weights and branch lengths, and will shift the likelihood scores to be <em>closer to zero</em>.</p>
<p>The regularization terms affect the likelihood score, so they should be kept constant whenever fits of different graphs are compared to each other.</p>

<a href="#edge-constraints" class="anchor"></a>Edge constraints</h3>
<p>When fitting an admixture graph, we search for admixture and drift weights which minimize the sum of squared differences between expected and observed <em>f</em>-statistics. Usually the drift edges are constrained to be non-negative, and the admixture weights are constrained to be between zero and one, and to add up to one at each admixture node.</p>
<p>It is possible to fit a graph without these constraints, by setting <code>constrained = FALSE</code> in <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code>.</p>

drift lengths or admixture weights are difficult to interpret, but they are used by <code><a href="../reference/find_graphs.html">find_graphs()</a></code> for more efficiently searching the space of graph topologies.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s often more useful in practice is to put additional constraints on some edges, for example requiring at least a certain amount of admixture from a source, or restricting how much drift can occur on a particular edge. We can do this by passing a graph in data frame format with columns <code>lower</code> and <code>upper</code> to <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code>. (Note the difference between the columns <code>lower</code> and <code>upper</code>, which will constrain the fit of a graph when used as input to <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code>, and the columns <code>low</code> and <code>high</code>, which are generated in the output and report the lowest and highest weights for different initial values!)</p>
<p>In this example one admixture edge is constrained to be exactly 0.3 by setting both its lower and its upper bound:</p>

<p>An advantage of being able to quickly evaluate a single model using precomputed <em>f</em>-statistics is that we can evaluate many different graphs in order to find graph topologies with good fits. This can either be done in a fully automated way (similar to TreeMix) or in a semi-automated way, similar for example to the admixture graph R package.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/find_graphs.html">find_graphs()</a></code> attempts to automatically find admixture graphs that are compatible with the observed f-statistics. It generates and evaluates <code>numgraphs</code> admixture graphs in <code>numgen</code> generations, and in each generation selects and modifies the best graphs.</p>

<a href="#comparing-the-fits-of-different-graphs" class="anchor"></a>Comparing the fits of different graphs</h2>
<p>If two different graphs model the same populations and the second graph has a better likelihood score than the first one, it suggests that the second graph is a better representation of the actual demographic history. Thatâ€™s generally true, but there are two complications:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If the second graph is more complex (i.e.Â if it has more admixture events), it has more degrees of freedom and thus an unfair advantage over the first one. It might get a better score even if the simpler graph is closer to the true demographic history.</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible that the difference in scores is due to chance, and not because one of the two models really fits the data better. What if we had picked different samples from each population? Or what if we had picked different SNPs? Would the second model still be preferred over the first one?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> solves the first problem by computing out-of-sample scores, and the second problem by computing the fit of a graph using bootstrap-resampled SNP blocks.</p>

<p><em>qpGraph</em> likelihood scores <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> are computed by comparing estimated f3-statistics <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> to fitted f3-statistics <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> - those that we would expect to observe under a given admixture graph. The difference between estimated and fitted f3-statistics, the residuals, are adjusted by the inverse covariance matrix of f3-statistics <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, to get the likelihood score. If this covariance matrix was the identity matrix, the scores would just be the squared sum of residuals.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S = -\frac{1}{2} (g - f)' Q^{-1} (g - f)\]</span></p>
<p>Under this definition likelihood scores are actually negative, but usually the minus sign is dropped and positive scores are reported instead.</p>
<p>In fitting edge weights, <em>qpGraph</em> maximizes this likelihood score (bringing it closer to 0). To avoid overfitting, we can compute a new score <span class="math inline">\(S'\)</span> after fitting the model, using SNPs (or SNP blocks) which havenâ€™t been used for fitting the model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S' = -\frac{1}{2} (g_{train} - f_{test})' Q^{-1} (g_{train} - f_{test})\]</span></p>
<p>These scores tend to be further away from zero, but they allow us to fairly compare models of different complexity to each other.</p>
<p>In <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>, you can compute out-of-sample scores by providing the <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code> function with an <code>f2_blocks_test</code> argument.</p>

<a href="#bootstrap-resampled-graph-fits" class="anchor"></a>Bootstrap-resampled graph fits</h3>
<p>Out-of-sample scores allow us to get fair comparisons for any two admixture graphs, but they still donâ€™t tell us whether a difference is significant. For that, we can use bootstrap resampling of SNP blocks: Each graph is evaluated many times on a random subset of SNP blocks. The variation among those scores tells us whether the scores of both graphs are significantly different from one another.</p>
<p>To combine this idea with out-of-sample scores to prevent overfitting, we can use the SNP blocks which were not selected in each bootstrap iteration as the out-of-sample SNP blocks.</p>
<p>The following example shows how to test whether <code>graph1</code> gives a significantly better fit than <code>graph2</code>:</p>

<p>Fitting a graph multiple times on different sets of SNPs is not only useful for comparing two graphs. It also allows us to put confidence intervals on the parameters estimated in a single graph.</p>

<a href="#summarizing-graphs" class="anchor"></a>Summarizing graphs</h2>
<p>Admixture graphs for more than a few populations quickly become very complex. They contain a large amount of information about the relationship between the modeled populations, which is another way of saying that the number of possible graphs grows rapidly as the number of populations and the number of admixture events grows.</p>
<p>Often there are specific features of an admixture graph that are of primary interest. For example, whether a population is admixed or unadmixed, relative to the other modeled populations, or what the temporal order of two events is (whether one population split occurred before or after another population split).</p>
<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> offers a number of functions that can summarize graphs by listing their features, as well as functions that can be used to test whether graphs exhibits specific features. This is useful in several contexts, for example it can constrain the search space for finding well fitting graphs, by not considering graphs with specific properties.</p>
<p>At the moment there are three types of features or constraints, and for each there is a function for listing the graph features, and a function for testing whether a graph meets certain constraints.</p>

<p>To put constraints on the number of admixtures for some of our populations, we can create a data frame with columns <code>pop</code>, <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>. The following example shows how to specify that population <em>C</em> should have at least one admixture event, while <em>D</em> should be unadmixed:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb53"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">constrain_cd</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu">tribble</span><span class="op">(</span>
  <span class="op">~</span><span class="va">pop</span>, <span class="op">~</span><span class="va">min</span>, <span class="op">~</span><span class="va">max</span>,
  <span class="st">'C'</span>, <span class="fl">1</span>, <span class="cn">NA</span>,
  <span class="st">'D'</span>, <span class="cn">NA</span>, <span class="fl">0</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This can be used to test whether a graph meets these constraints:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb54"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">g</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/random_admixturegraph.html">random_admixturegraph</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">5</span>, <span class="fl">2</span><span class="op">)</span>

<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<p>If we have a list of admixture graphs, we could select only those that meet the constraints:</p>

<p>And if we want to filter the output of <code><a href="../reference/find_graphs.html">find_graphs()</a></code>, we could do it with this expresession:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb57"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>We can also generate a random graph that satisfies these constraints:</p>

<pre><code>## [1] 525.6257</code></pre>
<p>An admixture graph only captures some of the parameters which determine the full demographic history (particularly when is hasnâ€™t been fitted and there is just a topology). Therefore, some assumptions are being made when simulations are generated by <code><a href="../reference/msprime_sim.html">msprime_sim()</a></code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective population size and mutation rates are constant</li>
<li>Time points of branch splits and admixture events are proportional to the position on the y-axis of the graph representation created by <code><a href="../reference/plotly_graph.html">plotly_graph()</a></code>
</li>
<li>All admixture proportions are in 30/70 proportions</li>
<li>All SNPs are independent. This is achieved by simulating a single SNP at a time, and is justified by the fact that the block-jackknife/bootstrap method which is used throughout <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> adequately controls for the effects of linked SNPs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these assumptions are not realistic and are only here for convenience and to reduce the simulation run time. Feel free to e-mail me suggestions for more sensible defaults.</p>
<p>If you want to override any of the default assumptions, you can do so in three ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p>By supplying a fitted graph to the <code><a href="../reference/msprime_sim.html">msprime_sim()</a></code> function</p>
<p>In this case, admixture weights of the fitted graph will be directly translated into simulated admixture proportions. Fitted drift lengths represent an unknown combination of time and effective population size. <code><a href="../reference/msprime_sim.html">msprime_sim()</a></code> will simulated fitted drift lengths by adjusting effective population sizes of the relevant populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By adjusting the <code>neff</code>, <code>time</code>, or <code>ind_per_pop</code> parameters of the <code><a href="../reference/msprime_sim.html">msprime_sim()</a></code> function</p>
<p>As in this example:</p>

Models which are contained within larger valid models are not shown. The number of valid qpAdm models can be very large for big graphs, so you should only run this on small graphs.</p>

<p>The only qpAdm models which are valid under this graph have <code>Den</code> as target and <code>Chi</code>, <code>Rus</code>, and <code>Swi</code> as right populations.</p>
<p>Valid qpAdm models need to satisfy the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>There have to be more right populations than left populations</li>
<li>The left populations should not form a clade with respect to any right population. This means that a qpgraph outgroup is not an informative right population, but it can be included anyway, with <code>add_outgroup</code>.</li>
<li>Each set of left populations which forms a source for the target population has to form a clade with target at the exclusion of each right population. (Note: Check if thatâ€™s correct and if it can be stated in a better way.)</li>
