<p><strong>Under construction</strong></p>
<p>ADMIXTOOLS 2 makes it easy to work with admixture graphs. It allows you to read and write them in a number of different formats, create them from scratch, and modify them in several ways. You can either modify them manually, one edge or one node at a time, or automatically, by generating all possible variations of a certain type (for example all graphs that result from adding one admixture edge to the current graph).</p>
<p>The purpose of all this is to find well fitting models, and to find out which models are not compatible with the data. This is further simplified by <code><a href="../reference/find_graphs.html">find_graphs()</a></code>, a function which automatically finds well fitting graphs by repeatedly selecting the best among a set of randomly modified graphs. ADMIXTOOLS 2 also introduces a method for testing whether one admixture graph fits the data significantly better than another.</p>

<a href="#graph-formats" class="anchor"></a>Graph formats</h2>
<p>ADMIXTOOLS 2 can read and write graphs in a number of different formats, including the format used by the original ADMIXTOOLS software and DOT format, but internally it uses only the following two representations of admixture graphs:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>An edge list</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This is either a matrix or a data frame where each edge is in a different row. The first column (<code>from</code>) contains the names of the source nodes, and the second column (<code>to</code>) contains the names of the target nodes. No distinction is made between admixture edges and drift edges, or between different types of nodes. Optionally, there are two more columns (<code>lower</code> and <code>upper</code>), which put constraints on the length of an edge. For admixture edges, these constraints should be between 0 and 1, and for drift edges they can range from 0 to infinity. No constraints are indicated by <code>NA</code>.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>An <code>igraph</code> graph object</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This format is used for most operations that modify graphs, since the <a href="https://igraph.org/r/">igraph package</a> provides many useful functions for working with graphs. If not otherwise specified, functions that take graphs as input expect a graph in this format.</li>
</ul>
<p>To convert an admixture graph from one of these representations to the other, you can use the <code>igraph</code> function <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/igraph/man/graph_from_edgelist.html">igraph::graph_from_edgelist()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/igraph/man/as_edgelist.html">igraph::as_edgelist()</a></code>.</p>
<div id="simplified-graphs" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#simplified-graphs" class="anchor"></a>Simplified graphs</h3>
<p>If you look at an admixture graph, you will probably notice that admixture edges originate at nodes which have no other outgoing edges. Many functions in ADMIXTOOLS 2 use simplified admixture graphs without those redundant nodes. While these nodes are redundant for the topology of a graph, they are still useful because they allow us to specify both admixture weights and drift weights for two merging branches.</p>
<p><code><a href="../reference/simplify_graph.html">simplify_graph()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/desimplify_graph.html">desimplify_graph()</a></code> can turn one representation into the other.</p>

<a href="#modifying-admixture-graphs" class="anchor"></a>Modifying admixture graphs</h2>
<p>Admixture graphs can be modified using the following functions:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/insert_edge.html">insert_edge</a></span>(example_igraph, <span class="dt">from =</span> <span class="st">"N2N1|Vindija.DG"</span>, <span class="dt">to =</span> <span class="st">"N3N1|Denisova.DG"</span>)</a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/insert_leaf.html">insert_leaf</a></span>(example_igraph, <span class="st">"newpop"</span>, <span class="dt">from =</span> <span class="st">"N4N"</span>, <span class="dt">to =</span> <span class="st">"Switzerland_Bichon.SG"</span>)</a>

<p>But itâ€™s probably easier to modify a graph interactively using the ADMIXTOOLS 2 GUI.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/run_shiny_admixtools.html">run_shiny_admixtools</a></span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Below you can see how a new admixture edge is added to a graph:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../man/figures/shinyapp1.gif" alt="app demo"><p class="caption">app demo</p>
</div>
<p>Rather than modifying admixture graphs manually and only testing a small number of models, you can start with a graph and let ADMIXTOOLS 2 generate and evaluate graphs for you.</p>
<p>The following functions take a graph and return lists of new, similar graphs:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-1" data-line-number="1">newgraphs =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/graph_plusone.html">graph_plusone</a></span>(example_graph)</a>

<p>To evaluate the new graphs, type:</p>

<p>The <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code> function tries to find the admixture- and drift-edge weights for a given graph topology which are most consistent with the observed <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics. The optimization of admixture weights requires initial values. Occasionally, these initial values have an effect on the final weight estimates because the optimization gets stuck in a local optimum. Because of this, the <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code> weight optimization is repeated by default with 10 different randomly chosen combinations of starting weights, and the final likelihood score represents the best score out of these 10 tries. The default value of 10 can be decreased to speed up <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code>, or increased to reduce the risk of missing the global optimum.</p>
<p>To get a better sense of how stable the edge weight optimization is, it makes sense to inspect the <code>opt</code> output of <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code>. This data frame contains all random initial weight combinations, as well as the optimized weights, final scores (<code>value</code>) and additional information about the optimization generated by the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/optim.html">optim()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>In this example, the optimization is very stable, and the initial values do not affect the estimated weights or the score:</p>

<p>The first steps in <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code> are computing <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics from <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics, and computing the inverse of the <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistic covariance matrix. When many graphs are evaluated for the same populations, it can be faster to run these steps only once and pass <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics and the inverse of the covariance matrix to the <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code> function. That is the purpose of the <code>f3precomp</code> and <code>ppinv</code> arguments. The <code>f3precomp</code> argument expects a list with <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics and the inverse of the covariance matrix. It is used for example in <code><a href="../reference/find_graphs.html">find_graphs()</a></code>.</p>
<p>The <code>ppinv</code> argument expects only the inverse of the covariance matrix, while <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics will be computed inside <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code>. This is used in <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph_resample_multi.html">qpgraph_resample_multi()</a></code> to use an inverse covariance matrix computed on a different set of SNPs.</p>

<div id="regularization-terms" class="section level3">

<p>There are two regularization terms (fudge factors) used in qpGraph, which make matrix inversions more stable. One is added to the diagonal elements of the <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span> covariance matrix (after multiplying it by the mean of the diagonal elements). It is called <code>fudge_cov</code> and defaults to 10<sup>-5</sup>. Increasing this factor has a small effect on admixture weights and branch lengths, but will shift the likelihood scores to be <em>closer to zero</em>.</p>
<p>The other regularization terms is added to the covariance matrix of fitted branch lengths (after scaling as before). It is called <code>fudge</code> and defaults to 10<sup>-4</sup>. In the original <em>qpGraph</em> program, this parameter can be set through the <code>diag</code> parameter. Increasing <code>fudge</code> will shift the likelihood scores to be <em>further away from zero</em>. This regularization term ensures that edge weights will be evenly distributed across a set of edges whose weights could otherwise not be determined unambiguously. (As is often the case with the two edges originating in the root node.)</p>
<p>As these regularization terms affect the likelihood score, they should be kept constant whenever fits of different graphs are compared to each other.</p>

<p>If two different graphs model the same populations and the second graph has a better likelihood score than the first one, it suggests that the second graph is a better representation of the actual demographic history. Thatâ€™s generally true, but there are two complications:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If the second graph is more complex (i.e.Â if it has more admixture events), it has more degrees of freedom and thus an unfair advantage over the first one. It might get a better score even if the simpler graph is closer to the true demographic history.</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible that the difference in scores is due to chance, and not because one of the two models really fits the data better. What if we had picked different samples from each population? Or what if we had picked different SNPs? Would the second model still be preferred over the first one?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>ADMIXTOOLS 2 solves the first problem by computing out-of-sample scores, and the second problem by computing the fit of a graph using bootstrap-resampled SNP blocks.</p>
<div id="out-of-sample-scores" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#out-of-sample-scores" class="anchor"></a>Out-of-sample scores</h3>
<p><em>qpGraph</em> likelihood scores <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> are computed by comparing estimated f3-statistics <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> to fitted f3-statistics <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> - those that we would expect to observe under a given admixture graph. The difference between estimated and fitted f3-statistics, the residuals, are adjusted by the inverse covariance matrix of f3-statistics <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, to get the likelihood score. If this covariance matrix was the identity matrix, the scores would just be the squared sum of residuals.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S = -\frac{1}{2} (g - f)' Q^{-1} (g - f)\]</span></p>
<p>Under this definition likelihood scores are actually negative, but usually the minus sign is dropped and positive scores are reported instead.</p>
<p>In fitting edge weights, <em>qpGraph</em> maximizes this likelihood score (bringing it closer to 0). To avoid overfitting, we can compute a new score after fitting the model, using SNPs (or SNP blocks) which havenâ€™t been used for fitting the model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S' = -\frac{1}{2} (g_{train} - f_{test})' Q^{-1} (g_{train} - f_{test})\]</span></p>
<p>These scores tend to be further away from zero, but they allow us to fairly compare models of different complexity to each other.</p>
<p>In ADMIXTOOLS 2, you can compute out-of-sample scores by providing the <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code> function with an <code>f2_blocks_test</code> argument.</p>

<p>Out-of-sample scores allow us to get fair comparisons for any two admixture graphs, but they still donâ€™t tell us whether a difference is significant. For that, we can use bootstrap resampling of SNP blocks: Each graph is evaluated many times on a random subset of SNP blocks. The variation among those scores tells us whether the scores of both graphs are significantly different from one another.</p>
<p>To combine this idea with out-of-sample scores to prevent overfitting, we can use the SNP blocks which were not selected in each bootstrap iteration as the out-of-sample SNP blocks.</p>
<p>The following example shows how to test whether <code>graph1</code> gives a significantly better fit than <code>graph2</code>:</p>

<p>The output for this population triple (1: <code>Rus</code>, 2: <code>Swi</code>, 3: <code>Den</code>) can be read like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>numgraphs</code>: 200 graphs were compared</li>
<li>
<code>clade</code>: In 34.5% of all graphs <code>Rus</code> and <code>Swi</code> form a clade with respect to <code>Den</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>x13</code>: In 0.5% of all graphs <code>Rus</code> is closer to <code>Den</code> than <code>Swi</code> is to <code>Den</code>, with ancestors of <code>Rus</code> admixing into <code>Den</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>x31</code>: In 50.5% of all graphs <code>Rus</code> is closer to <code>Den</code> than <code>Swi</code> is to <code>Den</code>, with ancestors of <code>Den</code> admixing into <code>Rus</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>x23</code>: In 24.5% of all graphs <code>Swi</code> is closer to <code>Den</code> than <code>Rus</code> is to <code>Den</code>, with ancestors of <code>Swi</code> admixing into <code>Den</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>x32</code>: In 38.0% of all graphs <code>Swi</code> is closer to <code>Den</code> than <code>Rus</code> is to <code>Den</code>, with ancestors of <code>Den</code> admixing into <code>Swi</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>toptopo</code>: The most common topology for this triple across all graphs. <code>011111</code> specifies a topology where condition <code>x13</code> is not satisfied, but conditions <code>x23</code>, <code>x31</code>, <code>x32</code>, <code>x12</code>, and <code>x21</code> are satisfied. A topology starting with <code>0000</code> is one where the first two populations form a clade.</li>
<li>
<code>toptopocnt</code>: The number of times <code>toptopo</code> was observed</li>
<li>
<code>topos</code>: The number of times each topology was observed</li>

<p>Every admixture graph maps to a specific set of valid qpAdm models. The function <code>qpadm_models</code> lists all valid qpAdm models for a graph. Models which are contained within larger valid models are not shown. The number of valid qpAdm models can be very large for big graphs, so you should only run this on small graphs.</p>

<p>The only qpAdm models which are valid under this graph have <code>Den</code> as target and <code>Chi</code>, <code>Rus</code>, and <code>Swi</code> as right populations.</p>
<p>Valid qpAdm models need to satisfy the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>There have to be more right populations than left populations</li>
<li>The left populations should not form a clade with respect to any right population. This means that a qpgraph outgroup is not an informative right population, but it can be included anyway, with <code>add_outgroup</code>.</li>
<li>Each set of left populations which forms a source for the target population has to form a clade with target at the exclusion of each right population. (Note: Check if thatâ€™s correct and if it can be stated in a better way.)</li>
</ul>
