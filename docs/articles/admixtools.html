<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> is a set of programs used to infer population histories from genetic data. The main use cases are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding out if a population is admixed between other populations (<a href="admixtools.html#f3-and-qp3pop"><span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span></a>, <a href="admixtools.html#qpwave-and-qpadm"><em>qpAdm</em></a>)</li>
<li>Estimating admixture weights (<em>qpF4ratio</em>, <a href="admixtools.html#qpwave-and-qpadm"><em>qpAdm</em></a>)</li>
<li>Finding out if a set of populations forms a clade relative to another set (<a href="admixtools.html#f3-and-qp3pop"><span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span></a>, <a href="admixtools.html#qpwave-and-qpadm"><em>qpWave</em></a>)</li>
<li>Estimating the number of admixture waves separating two sets of populations (<a href="admixtools.html#qpwave-and-qpadm"><em>qpWave</em></a>)</li>
<li>Fitting an admixture graph to a set of populations (<a href="admixtools.html#qpgraph"><em>qpGraph</em></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is based on <em>f</em>-statistics (<span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>), and all <em>f</em>-statistics can be derived from <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> statistics.</p>
<p>Because of this, <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> divides the computations into two steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Computing <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics and storing them on disk. This can be slow since it accesses the genotype data.</li>
<li>Using <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics to fit models. This is fast because <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics are very compact compared to genotype data.</li>
</ol>
<p>This page shows how standard <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> analyses can be conducted in <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>. In addition to that, <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> introduces a range of new methods, mostly focused on admixture graphs, which are intended to make analyses simpler, faster, and most importantly, more robust. These methods focus on quantifying variability by resampling SNPs, automated exploration of graph topologies, and simulating data under admixture graphs. They are described <a href="#graphs.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="f-statistics-basics" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#f-statistics-basics" class="anchor"></a><em>f</em>-statistics basics</h2>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span> describe how populations are related to one another. All <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> programs are based on these <em>f</em>-statistics. Here, we briefly define them and describe how to compute them. Two excellent papers on <em>f</em>-statistics can be found <a href="https://www.genetics.org/content/192/3/1065">here</a> and <a href="https://www.genetics.org/content/202/4/1485">here</a>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> measures the amount of genetic drift that separates two populations. It is the expected squared difference in allele frequencies and can be estimated across <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> SNPs as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_2(A,B) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^M(a_{j} - b_{j})^2\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are populations, and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are their allele frequencies at SNP <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>In practice, the estimation of <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> is more complicated than shown here, because it needs to account for low sample counts, missing data, and differences in ploidy. This is described <a href="fstats.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The real strength of <em>f</em>-statistics based methods comes from combining <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics into <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics and <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span> measures the amount of drift that is shared between two population pairs. It is the covariance of allele frequency differences in each pair, and at the same time the sum of four <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
f_4(A, B; C, D) &amp;= \frac{1}{M}\sum_{j=1}^M(a_{j} - b_{j})(c_{j} - d_{j}) \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(f_2(A, D) + f_2(B, C) - f_2(A, C) - f_2(B, D) )
\label{eq:f42}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> form a clade relative to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, there should not be any correlation in the allele frequency differences <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(f_4(A, B; C, D)\)</span> should be zero. If <span class="math inline">\(f_4(A, B; C, D)\)</span> is significantly different from zero, it suggests that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are not a clade relative to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>.</p>
<p>Like <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span> is the covariance of allele frequency differences between two pairs of populations. The difference is that in <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>, one population is the same on both sides. <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span> is thus a special case of <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
f_3(A; B, C) &amp;= f_4(A, B; A, C) \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2} (f_2(A, B) + f_2(A, C) - f_2(B, C))
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(f_3(A; B, C)\)</span> is negative, it means that the more similar allele frequencies are between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, the more different they are between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, which suggests that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is admixed between <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, or populations close to them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span> partition genetic drift into a component that is specific to single populations and a component that is shared between two pairs of populations. By measuring only the <em>shared</em> drift between pairs of populations, we can make conclusive statements about their relationships. Methods such as PCA and <em>ADMIXTURE</em> do not exclude non-shared drift, and therefore don’t produce results that can be interpreted as unambiguously. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(f_3(A; B, C)\)</span> is negative, this is conclusive evidence that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is admixed between <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. In that case we would expect <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to fall in between <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> in PC space. However, the same PCA pattern could be the results of a range of other demographic histories (for example, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> could be ancestral to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>).</p>

</h2>
<p>In <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>, <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics are the foundation for all further analyses. They can be computed from genotype data and saved to disk with this command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">prefix</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">'/path/to/geno'</span>
<span class="va">my_f2_dir</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">'/store/f2data/here/'</span>

<span class="fu"><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">prefix</span>, <span class="va">my_f2_dir</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will look for genotype files in <em>packedancestrymap</em> or <em>PLINK</em> format, compute allele frequencies and blocked <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics for all pairs of populations defined in the <code>.ind</code> or <code>.fam</code> file, and write them to <code>my_f2_dir</code>. It is also possible to extract only a subset of the samples or populations by passing IDs to the <code>inds</code> and <code>pops</code> arguments in <code><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2()</a></code>. To get a description of the arguments and to see examples of how to use it, type</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="op">?</span><span class="va">extract_f2</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By default, <code><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2()</a></code> will be very cautious and exclude all SNPs which are missing in any population (<code>maxmiss = 0</code>). If you lose too many SNPs this way, you can either</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>limit the number of populations for which to extract <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics,</li>
<li>compute <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>- and <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics directly from genotype files, or</li>
<li>increase the <code>maxmiss</code> parameter (<code>maxmiss = 1</code> means no SNPs will be excluded).</li>
</ol>
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches are described <a href="fstats.html#bias-due-to-missing-data">here</a>. Briefly, when running <code><a href="../reference/qpadm.html">qpadm()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/qpdstat.html">qpdstat()</a></code> it can be better to choose the safer but slower options 1 and 2, while for <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code>, which is not centered around hypothesis testing, it is usually fine choose option 3. Since the absolute difference in <em>f</em>-statistics between these approaches is usually small, it can also make sense to use option 3 for exploratory analyses, and confirm key results using options 1 or 2.</p>
<p>Once <code><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2()</a></code> has finished, <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics for the populations of interest can be loaded using <code><a href="../reference/f2_from_precomp.html">f2_from_precomp()</a></code>:</p>

<p>Or you can load only a subset of the populations:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">mypops</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">'Denisova.DG'</span>, <span class="st">'Altai_Neanderthal.DG'</span>, <span class="st">'Vindija.DG'</span><span class="op">)</span>

<p>If your data is so small that computing <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics doesn’t take very long, you can skip writing the data to disk with <code><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2()</a></code> and do everything in one step using <code><a href="../reference/f2_from_geno.html">f2_from_geno()</a></code>:</p>

<p><code>f2_blocks</code> is now a 3d-array with <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics for each population pair along dimensions 1 and 2, and each SNP block along the 3rd dimension.</p>

<p>The purpose of having separate estimates for each SNP block is to compute <a href="resampling.html">jackknife or bootstrap standard errors</a> for <em>f</em>-statistics, and for any statistics derived from them.</p>

<p>There are three main uses of <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Testing whether a population is admixed: If <span class="math inline">\(f_3(A; B, C)\)</span> is negative, this suggests that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is admixed between a population related to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and one related to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</li>
<li>Estimating the relative divergence time for pairs of populations (outgroup <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics): Pairwise <span class="math inline">\(F_{ST}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> are simpler estimates of genetic distance or divergence time, but they are affected by differences in population size.

<li>Fitting admixture graphs: <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics of the form <span class="math inline">\(f_3(O; i, j)\)</span> for an arbitrary population <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, and all pairs of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are used in <em>qpGraph</em>, which is described below.</li>

<p>The differences between <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics and <em>D</em>-statistics are usually negligible.

However, it is the most widely used metric to estimate the genetic distance between populations. Running <code><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2()</a></code> will create files which don’t only contain <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> estimates for each population pair, but also separate <span class="math inline">\(F_{ST}\)</span> estimates.

<p><em>qpWave</em> and <em>qpAdm</em> are two programs with different goals - <em>qpWave</em> is used for estimating the number of admixture events, and <em>qpAdm</em> is used for estimating admixture weights - but they perform almost the same computations.

In <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>, both <code><a href="../reference/qpadm.html">qpadm()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/qpwave.html">qpwave()</a></code>require at least three arguments:</p>

<p>Swapping some populations between the <code>left</code> and the <code>right</code> set is one common way to run multiple <code><a href="../reference/qpadm.html">qpadm()</a></code> models. There is also a more general function, in which you can specify any models that you want to run. This is faster than looping over several calls to the <code><a href="../reference/qpadm.html">qpadm()</a></code> function, in particular when reading data from a genotype matrix directly, because it re-uses f4-statistics.</p>
<p>To specify the <code><a href="../reference/qpadm.html">qpadm()</a></code> models you want to run, you need to make a data frame with columns <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>target</code>, where each model is in a different row.</p>

<p>Single <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>- and <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics can tell us how three or four populations are related to each other. <em>qpGraph</em> generalizes this concept to any number of populations. It takes estimated <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics and the topology of an admixture graph, finds the edges weights that minimize the difference between fitted and estimated <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics, and summarizes that difference in a likelihood score. A good model should fit all <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics, and have a score close to zero.</p>

<p>Here, <code>example_graph</code> is a specific graph included in this R package, but you can provide any other graph in one of three formats.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>An <a href="https://igraph.org/r/">igraph</a> object.</li>
<li>A two column matrix or data frame, where each row is an edge, the first column is the source of the edge, and the second column is the target. Additional columns labelled <code>lower</code> and <code>upper</code> can be used to constrain certain edges (<code>NA</code> = no constraint).</li>
<li>The location of a <em>qpGraph</em> graph file, which will be read and parsed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The leaf nodes of this graph have to match the <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistic population labels, and the graph has to be a valid admixture graph: a directed acyclic graph where each node has no more than two parents. If nodes with more than two children are present (polytomies or multifurcations) they will be split in a random order, and the new drift edges will be constrained to 0.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The output of <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code> is a list with several items:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>edges</strong>: A data frame with estimated edge weights. This includes normal edges as well as admixture edges.</li>
<li>
<strong>score</strong> The likelihood score. Smaller scores indicate a better fit.</li>
<li>
<strong>f2</strong> Estimated <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics and standard errors for all population pairs</li>
<li>
<strong>f3</strong> Estimated and fitted <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics for all population pairs with the outgroup. This includes residuals and z-scores.</li>
<li>
<strong>opt</strong> A data frame with details from the weight optimization, with one row per set of starting values.</li>
<li>
<strong>ppinv</strong> The inverse of the <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics covariance matrix</li>
</ul>
<p>Optionally, fitted and estimated <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics are returned as <strong>f4</strong> and the worst residual z-score as <strong>worst_residual</strong> if <code>return_f4</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>. When <code>f2_blocks_test</code> is provided, an out-of-sample score is computed and returned as <strong>score_test</strong>.</p>
<p>The fitted graph can be plotted like this:</p>

<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> can automatically find well-fitting graphs, and it has several functions for exploring the topological neighborhood of a graph. These functions are described <a href="graphs.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>To get a better theoretical understanding of <em>f</em>-statistics and admixture graphs, I recommend <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1755-0998.13230">this paper</a>.</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#comparing-results-between-admixtools-and-admixtools-2" class="anchor"></a>Comparing results between <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> and <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>
</h2>
<p>The results of <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> should generally match those of <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em>. However, there are a few parameters where the default behavior in <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> differs in subtle ways from that in <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Selection of SNPs</p>
<p>Different <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> programs select SNPs in slightly different ways.<em>qpDstat</em> selects different SNPs for each <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistic (similar to <code>allsnps: YES</code> in <em>qpAdm</em> and <em>qpGraph</em>). The default in <em>qpAdm</em> and <em>qpGraph</em> is to select only those SNPs which are present in all populations in the tested model (<code>allsnps: NO</code>). In addition to that, some programs discard SNPs which have identical allele frequencies in all populations, while others do not. (The SNPs that remain are sometimes called “polymorphic” here. They are polymorphic not in the traditional meaning, but with regard to their allele frequencies.) While those SNPs are not informative in the sense that they do not shift <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics away from zero, they can still have a small impact on the magnitude of the estimate, and on the total number of SNPs used.</p>
<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> is set up in such a way that the default options are the same as in <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> in most cases. However, missing data can <a href="fstats.html#bias-due-to-missing-data-1">make things complicated</a>. Most notably, in order to get the default behavior of the original <em>qpDstat</em>, the first argument to the <code><a href="../reference/qpdstat.html">qpdstat()</a></code> function has to be the prefix of genotype files. Similarly, to get the <code>allsnps: YES</code> behavior of <em>qpAdm</em> and <em>qpGraph</em>, the first argument to the <code><a href="../reference/qpadm.html">qpadm()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/qpgraph.html">qpgraph()</a></code> functions has to be the prefix of genotype files and in addition to that, the <code>allsnps</code> parameter in these functions should be set to <code>TRUE</code>. With regard to the use of non-polymorphic/non-informative SNPs, <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> includes them for the computation for <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics, but not for the computation of allele frequency products. This usually makes very little difference, but it makes it possible to imitate the default behavior of the original <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pseudohaploid data</p>
<p>In <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em>, it is recommended to use the option <code>inbreed: YES</code> when dealing with pseudohaploid data. This will ensure that when the low-sample-size correction factor for <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics is computed, each pseudohaploid sample contributes only one haplotype. However, this will not work for populations of only a single pseudohaploid sample. Which is not a big problem, because the default option <code>inbreed: NO</code> usually gives very similar results.</p>
<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> automatically detects which samples are diploid and which samples are pseudohaploid based on the first 1000 SNPs, and computes the correction factor appropriately. The exact default behavior of <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> (<code>inbreed: NO</code>) can be recovered by setting <code>adjust_pseudohaploid = FALSE</code> in <code><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2()</a></code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span> vs D-statistics</p>
<p>In <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em>, <em>qpDstat</em> computes D-statistics by default <code>f4mode: YES</code> will compute instead compute <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>. This is reversed in <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>: The default is <code>f4mode = TRUE</code>, and setting it to false will compute D-statistics. The reason for this is that <code>f4mode = FALSE</code> (computing D-statistics) is only possible when the first argument to the function is the prefix of genotype files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>To make it easier to compare <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> to <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>, there are wrapper function which call the original <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> programs and read the results.</p>
