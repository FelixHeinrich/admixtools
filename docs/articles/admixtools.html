<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> is a set of programs used to infer population histories from genetic data. The main use cases are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding out if a population is admixed between other populations (<a href="admixtools.html#f3-and-qp3pop"><span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span></a>, <a href="admixtools.html#qpwave-and-qpadm"><em>qpAdm</em></a>)</li>
<li>Estimating admixture weights (<em>qpF4ratio</em>, <a href="admixtools.html#qpwave-and-qpadm"><em>qpAdm</em></a>)</li>
<li>Finding out if a set of populations forms a clade relative to another set (<a href="admixtools.html#f3-and-qp3pop"><span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span></a>, <a href="admixtools.html#qpwave-and-qpadm"><em>qpWave</em></a>)</li>
<li>Estimating the number of admixture waves separating two sets of populations (<a href="admixtools.html#qpwave-and-qpadm"><em>qpWave</em></a>)</li>
<li>Fitting an admixture graph to a set of populations (<a href="admixtools.html#qpgraph"><em>qpGraph</em></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is based on <em>f</em>-statistics (<span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>), and all <em>f</em>-statistics can be derived from <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> statistics.</p>
<p>Because of this, <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> divides the computations into two steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Computing <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics and storing them on disk. This can be slow since it accesses the genotype data.</li>
<li>Using <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics to fit models. This is fast because <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics are very compact compared to genotype data.</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="f-statistics-basics" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#f-statistics-basics" class="anchor"></a><em>f</em>-statistics basics</h2>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span> describe how populations are related to one another. All <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> programs are based on these <em>f</em>-statistics. Here, we briefly define them and describe how to compute them. Two excellent papers on <em>f</em>-statistics can be found <a href="https://www.genetics.org/content/192/3/1065">here</a> and <a href="https://www.genetics.org/content/202/4/1485">here</a>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> measures the amount of genetic drift that separates two populations. It is the expected squared difference in allele frequencies and can be estimated across <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> SNPs as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_2(A,B) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^M(a_{j} - b_{j})^2\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are populations, and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are their allele frequencies.</p>
<p>In practice, the estimation of <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> is more complicated than shown here, because it needs to account for low sample counts, missing data, and differences in ploidy. This is described <a href="fstats.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The real strength of <em>f</em>-statistics based methods comes from combining <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics into <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>-statistics and <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span> measures the amount of drift that is shared between two population pairs. It is the covariance of allele frequency differences in each pair, and at the same time the sum of four <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
f_4(A, B; C, D) &amp;= \frac{1}{M}\sum_{j=1}^M(a_{j} - b_{j})(c_{j} - d_{j}) \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(f_2(A, D) + f_2(B, C) - f_2(A, C) - f_2(B, D) )
\label{eq:f42}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> form a clade relative to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, there should not be any correlation in the allele frequency differences <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(f_4(A, B; C, D)\)</span> should be zero. If <span class="math inline">\(f_4(A, B; C, D)\)</span> is significantly different from zero, it suggests that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are not a clade relative to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>.</p>
<p>Like <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span> is the covariance of allele frequency differences between two pairs of populations. The difference is that in <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>, one population is the same on both sides. <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span> is thus a special case of <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
f_3(A; B, C) &amp;= f_4(A, B; A, C) \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2} (f_2(A, B) + f_2(A, C) - f_2(B, C))
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(f_3(A; B, C)\)</span> is negative, it means that the more similar allele frequencies are between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, the more different they are between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, which suggests that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is admixed between <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, or populations close to them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span> partition genetic drift into a component that is specific to single populations and a component that is shared between two pairs of populations. By measuring only the <em>shared</em> drift between pairs of populations, we can make conclusive statements about their relationships. Methods such as PCA and <em>ADMIXTURE</em> do not exclude non-shared drift, and therefore donâ€™t produce results that can be interpreted as unambiguously. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(f_3(A; B, C)\)</span> is negative, this is conclusive evidence that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is admixed between <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. In that case we would expect <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to fall in between <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> in PC space. However, the same PCA pattern could also be the results of other demographic histories (<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> could be ancestral to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>).</p>

</h2>
<p>In <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>, <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics are the foundation for all further analyses. They can be computed from genotype data and saved to disk with this command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1">prefix =<span class="st"> '/path/to/geno'</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" data-line-number="2">my_f2_dir =<span class="st"> '/store/f2data/here/'</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" data-line-number="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2</a></span>(prefix, my_f2_dir)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This will look for genotype files in <em>packedancestrymap</em> or <em>PLINK</em> format, compute allele frequencies and blocked <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics for all pairs of populations defined in the <code>.ind</code> or <code>.fam</code> file, and write them to <code>my_f2_dir</code>. It is also possible to extract only a subset of the samples or populations by passing IDs to the <code>inds</code> and <code>pops</code> arguments in <code><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2()</a></code>. To get a description of the arguments and to see examples of how to use it, type</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" data-line-number="1">?extract_f2</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Once finished, <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics for the populations of interest can be loaded using <code><a href="../reference/f2_from_precomp.html">f2_from_precomp()</a></code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-1" data-line-number="1">f2_blocks =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/f2_from_precomp.html">f2_from_precomp</a></span>(my_f2_dir)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Or you can load only a subset of the populations:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1" data-line-number="1">mypops =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span>(<span class="st">'Denisova.DG'</span>, <span class="st">'Altai_Neanderthal.DG'</span>, <span class="st">'Vindija.DG'</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-2" data-line-number="2">f2_blocks =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/f2_from_precomp.html">f2_from_precomp</a></span>(my_f2_dir, <span class="dt">pops =</span> mypops)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>If your data is so small that computing <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics doesnâ€™t take very long, you can skip writing the data to disk with <code><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2()</a></code> and do everything in one step using <code><a href="../reference/f2_from_geno.html">f2_from_geno()</a></code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-1" data-line-number="1">f2_blocks =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/f2_from_geno.html">f2_from_geno</a></span>(my_f2_dir, <span class="dt">pops =</span> mypops)</a></code></pre></div>
<p><code>f2_blocks</code> is now a 3d-array with <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics for each population pair along dimensions 1 and 2, and each SNP block along the 3rd dimension.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/dim.html">dim</a></span>(f2_blocks)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1]   7   7 708</code></pre>
<p>The purpose of having separate estimates for each SNP block is to compute <a href="resampling.html">jackknife or bootstrap standard errors</a> for <em>f</em>-statistics, and for any statistics derived from them.</p>
<p><code>f2_blocks</code> can be used like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-1" data-line-number="1">f2_blocks[,,<span class="dv">1</span>]                <span class="co"># f2-statistics of the 1st SNP block</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/apply.html">apply</a></span>(f2_blocks, <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="dv">2</span>, mean)   <span class="co"># average across all blocks</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-3" data-line-number="3">f2_blocks[pop1, pop2, ]       <span class="co"># f2(pop1, pop2) for all blocks</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The names along the 3rd dimension contain the SNP block lengths:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-1" data-line-number="1">block_lengths =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">parse_number</span>(<span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/dimnames.html">dimnames</a></span>(f2_blocks)[[<span class="dv">3</span>]])</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/head.html">head</a></span>(block_lengths)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 424 772 795 835 574 842</code></pre>
<p>If you want to try any of this without extracting and loading your own <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics, you can instead use <code>example_f2_blocks</code> which becomes available as you load <code>admixtools</code>.</p>

<p>The differences between <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics and <em>D</em>-statistics are usually negligible. However, it is still possible to compute <em>D</em>-statistics in <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>, by providing genotype data as the first argument, and setting <code>f4mode = FALSE</code>:</p>

</h2>
<p><em>qpWave</em> and <em>qpAdm</em> are two programs with different goals - <em>qpWave</em> is used for estimating the number of admixture events, and <em>qpAdm</em> is used for estimating admixture weights - but they perform almost the same computations. The key difference is that <em>qpWave</em> compares two sets of populations (<code>left</code> and <code>right</code>), while <em>qpAdm</em> is tests how a single <code>target</code> population (which can be one of the <code>left</code> populations) relates to <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>. In <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>, both <code><a href="../reference/qpadm.html">qpadm()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/qpwave.html">qpwave()</a></code>require at least three arguments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics</li>
<li>A set of left populations</li>
<li>A set of right populations</li>

<p><code><a href="../reference/qpadm.html">qpadm()</a></code> additionally requires a <code>target</code> population as the 4th argument, which will be modeled as a mixture of <code>left</code> populations.</p>

<p>Optionally, fitted and estimated <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics are returned as <strong>f4</strong> and the worst residual z-score as <strong>worst_residual</strong> if <code>return_f4</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>. When <code>f2_blocks_test</code> is provided, an out-of-sample score is computed and returned as <strong>score_test</strong>.</p>
<p>The fitted graph can be plotted like this:</p>

<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> can automatically find well-fitting graphs, and it has several functions for exploring the topological neighborhood of a graph. These functions are described <a href="graphs.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>To get a better theoretical understanding of <em>f</em>-statistics and admixture graphs, I recommend <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1755-0998.13230">this paper</a>.</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#comparing-results-between-admixtools-and-admixtools-2" class="anchor"></a>Comparing results between <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> and <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>
</h2>
<p>The results of <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> should generally match those of <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em>. However, there are a few parameters where the default behavior in <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> differs in subtle ways from that in <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Selection of SNPs</p>
<p>The default behavior in <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> is to only use SNPs which are non-missing and polymorphic across all populations. The parameter <code>allsnps</code> can be used to instead compute each <em>f</em>-statistic from a potentially different set of SNPs; those that are non-missing in the populations described by each <em>f</em>-statistic.</p>
<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> doesnâ€™t have an <code>allsnps</code> option. Instead, there is a parameter called <code>maxmiss</code>. SNPs which are missing in a fraction of populations greater than <code>maxmiss</code> will be excluded. The default value <code>maxmiss = 1</code> ensures that <em>f</em>-statistics can be extracted for a large number of populations without discarding most SNPs. <code>maxmiss = 1</code> is equivalent to <code>allsnps: YES</code>. To imitate the default behavior <code>allsnps: NO</code>, set <code>maxmiss = 0</code>, or provide the list of SNPs to use with <code>keepsnps</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pseudohaploid data</p>
<p>In <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em>, it is recommended to use the option <code>inbreed: YES</code> when dealing with pseudohaploid data. This will ensure that when the low-sample-size correction factor for <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics is computed, each pseudohaploid sample contributes only one haplotype. However, this will not work for populations of only a single pseudohaploid sample. Which is not a big problem, because the default option <code>inbreed: NO</code> usually gives very similar results.</p>
<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> automatically detects which samples are diploid and which samples are pseudohaploid based on the first 1000 SNPs, and computes the correction factor appropriately. The exact default behavior of <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> (<code>inbreed: NO</code>) can be recovered by setting <code>adjust_pseudohaploid = FALSE</code> in <code><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2()</a></code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>To make it easier to compare <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> to <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>, there are wrapper function which call the original <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> programs and read the results.</p>
