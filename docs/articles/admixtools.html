<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> is a set of programs used to infer population histories from <em>f</em>-statistics computed from genetic data. <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> is a new implementation of these programs which can either be run through the <code>R</code> command line, or through a browser application that can be launched like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span>(admixtools)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/run_shiny_admixtools.html">run_shiny_admixtools</a></span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p>The documentation of the browser application can be accessed through the <code>?</code> in the upper right corner of the application window. This website documents the <code>R</code> command line interface.</p>
<p>The main use cases of the <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> programs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding out if a population is admixed between other populations (<a href="admixtools.html#f3-and-qp3pop"><span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span></a>, <a href="admixtools.html#qpwave-and-qpadm"><em>qpAdm</em></a>)</li>
<li>Finding out if a set of populations forms a clade relative to another set, and if not, how many admixture waves separate the two sets (<a href="admixtools.html#f3-and-qp3pop"><span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span></a>, <a href="admixtools.html#qpwave-and-qpadm"><em>qpWave</em></a>)</li>
<li>Fitting an admixture graph to a set of populations (<a href="admixtools.html#qpgraph"><em>qpGraph</em></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> divides the computations into two steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Computing <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics and storing them on disk. This can be slow since it accesses the genotype data.</li>
<li>Using <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics to fit models. This is fast because <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics are very compact compared to genotype data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because <em>f</em>-statistics form the basis for everything that follows, they will be covered first.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="f-statistics-basics" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#f-statistics-basics" class="anchor"></a><em>f</em>-statistics basics</h2>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span> describe how populations are related to one another, and they form the basis of <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em>. Here we briefly describe what they are and how to compute them. Two excellent papers on f-statistics can be found <a href="https://www.genetics.org/content/192/3/1065">here</a> and <a href="https://www.genetics.org/content/202/4/1485">here</a>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> is the average squared difference in allele frequencies between two populations. Upper case letters denote populations (<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>) and lower case letters denote their allele frequencies (<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_2(A,B) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^M(a_{j} - b_{j})^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span> is the covariance of allele frequency differences between two pairs of populations, and at the same time the sum of four f2-statistics: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
f_4(A, B; C, D) &amp;= \frac{1}{M}\sum_{j=1}^M(a_{j} - b_{j})(c_{j} - d_{j}) \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(f_2(A, D) + f_2(B, C) - f_2(A, C) - f_2(B, D) )
\label{eq:f42}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> form a clade relative to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, there should not be any correlation in the allele frequency differences <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(f_4(A, B; C, D)\)</span> should be zero. If <span class="math inline">\(f_4(A, B; C, D)\)</span> is significantly different from zero, it suggests that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are not a clade relative to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span> is the covariance of allele frequency differences between two pairs of populations where one population is the same on both sides. <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span> is thus a special case of <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>, and can also be written as a sum of <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
f_3(A; B, C) &amp;= f_4(A, B; A, C) \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2} (f_2(A, B) + f_2(A, C) - f_2(B, C))
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(f_3(A; B, C)\)</span> is negative, this means that the more similar allele frequencies are between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, the more different they are between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, which suggests that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is admixed between <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, or populations close to them.</p>
<p>In practice, the estimation of <em>f</em>-statistics can be more complicated than shown here, because it needs to account for low sample counts, missing data, and differences in ploidy. This is described <a href="fstats.html">here</a>.</p>

<div id="f2" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#f2" class="anchor"></a><em>f</em><sub>2</sub>
</h2>
<p>In <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>, <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics are the foundation for all further analyses. They can be computed from genotype data and saved to disk with this command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1">prefix =<span class="st"> '/path/to/geno'</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" data-line-number="2">my_f2_dir =<span class="st"> '/store/f2data/here/'</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" data-line-number="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2</a></span>(prefix, my_f2_dir)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This will look for genotype files in <em>packedancestrymap</em> or <em>PLINK</em> format, compute allele frequencies and blocked <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics for all pairs of populations defined in the <code>.ind</code> or <code>.fam</code> file, and write them to <code>my_f2_dir</code>. It is also possible to extract only a subset of the samples or populations by passing IDs to the <code>inds</code> and <code>pops</code> arguments in <code><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2()</a></code>. To get a description of the arguemnts and to see examples of how to use it, type</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" data-line-number="1">?extract_f2</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Once finished, <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics for the populations of interest can be loaded using <code><a href="../reference/f2_from_precomp.html">f2_from_precomp()</a></code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-1" data-line-number="1">f2_blocks =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/f2_from_precomp.html">f2_from_precomp</a></span>(my_f2_dir)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Or you can load only a subset of the populations:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1" data-line-number="1">mypops =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span>(<span class="st">'Denisova.DG'</span>, <span class="st">'Altai_Neanderthal.DG'</span>, <span class="st">'Vindija.DG'</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-2" data-line-number="2">f2_blocks =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/f2_from_precomp.html">f2_from_precomp</a></span>(my_f2_dir, <span class="dt">pops =</span> mypops)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>If your data is so small that computing <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics doesnâ€™t take very long, you can skip writing the data to disk with <code><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2()</a></code> and do everything in one step using <code><a href="../reference/f2_from_geno.html">f2_from_geno()</a></code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-1" data-line-number="1">f2_blocks =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/f2_from_geno.html">f2_from_geno</a></span>(my_f2_dir, <span class="dt">pops =</span> mypops)</a></code></pre></div>
<p><code>f2_blocks</code> is now a 3d-array with <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics for each population pair along dimensions 1 and 2, and each SNP block along the 3rd dimension.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/dim.html">dim</a></span>(f2_blocks)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1]   7   7 708</code></pre>
<p>The purpose of having separate estimates for each SNP block is to compute <a href="resampling.html">jackknife or bootstrap standard errors</a> for any <em>f</em>-statistic, and for any other estimated parameter.</p>
<p><code>f2_blocks</code> can be used like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-1" data-line-number="1">f2_blocks[,,<span class="dv">1</span>]                <span class="co"># f2-statistics of the 1st SNP block</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/apply.html">apply</a></span>(f2_blocks, <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="dv">2</span>, mean)   <span class="co"># average across all blocks</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-3" data-line-number="3">f2_blocks[pop1, pop2, ]       <span class="co"># f2(pop1, pop2) for all blocks</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The names along the 3rd dimension contain the SNP block lengths:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-1" data-line-number="1">block_lengths =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">parse_number</span>(<span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/dimnames.html">dimnames</a></span>(f2_blocks)[[<span class="dv">3</span>]])</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/head.html">head</a></span>(block_lengths)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 424 772 795 835 574 842</code></pre>
<p>If you want to try any of this without extracting and loading your own <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics, you can instead use <code>example_f2_blocks</code> which becomes available as you load <code>admixtools</code>.</p>

<p>The differences between <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics and <em>D</em>-statistics are usually negligible. However, it is still possible to compute <em>D</em>-statistics in <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>, by providing genotype data as the first argument, and setting <code>f4mode = FALSE</code>:</p>

<p><em>qpWave</em> and <em>qpAdm</em> are two programs with diffent goals - <em>qpWave</em> is used for estimating the number of admixture events, and <em>qpAdm</em> is used for estimating admixture weights - but they perform almost the same computations. The key difference is that <em>qpWave</em> compares two sets of populations (<code>left</code> and <code>right</code>), while <em>qpAdm</em> is tests how a single <code>target</code> population (which can be one of the <code>left</code> populations) relates to <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>. In <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>, both <code><a href="../reference/qpadm.html">qpadm()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/qpwave.html">qpwave()</a></code>require at least three arguments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics</li>
<li>A set of left populations</li>
<li>A set of right populations</li>
</ol>
<p><code><a href="../reference/qpadm.html">qpadm()</a></code> additionally requires a <code>target</code> population as the 4th argument, which will be modelled as a mixture of <code>left</code> populations.</p>

<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> can automatically find well-fitting graphs, and it has several functions for exploring the topological neighborhood of a graph. These functions are described <a href="graphs.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>To get a better theoretical understanding of <em>f</em>-statistics and admixture graphs, I recommend <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1755-0998.13230">this paper</a>.</p>
