<p>This tutorial gives an overview of the basic workflow for computing <em>f</em>-statistics, and using <em>qpWave</em>, <em>qpAdm</em>, and <em>qpGraph</em>. Documentation for each <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> function can be found under <em>Reference</em>, and more detailed information about specific topics under <em>Articles</em>.</p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS</em> is a set of programs used to infer population histories from f-statistics computed from genetic data. <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> divides the computation into two steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Computing <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics and storing them on disk. This can be slow since it accesses the genotype data.</li>
<li>Using <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics to fit models. This is fast because <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics are very compact compared to genotype data.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> can either be run through the <code>R</code> command line, or through a browser application that can be launched like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span>(admixtools)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/run_shiny_admixtools.html">run_shiny_admixtools</a></span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p>The documentation of the browser application can be accessed through the <code>?</code> in the upper right corner of the application window. This website documents the <code>R</code> command line interface.</p>
<p>For the examples below the following R packages need to be loaded.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span>(admixtools)</a>

<div id="f-statistics-basics" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#f-statistics-basics" class="anchor"></a><em>f</em>-statistics basics</h2>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span> describe how populations are related to one another, and they form the basis of <em>ADMIXTOOLS</em>. Here we briefly describe what they are and how to compute them. Two excellent papers on f-statistics can be found <a href="https://www.genetics.org/content/192/3/1065">here</a> and <a href="https://www.genetics.org/content/202/4/1485">here</a>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> is the expected squared difference in allele frequencies between two populations <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. (Allele frequencies are denoted in lower case letters here.) We can estimate it by averaging over <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> SNPs: <span class="math display">\[f_2(A,B) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^M(a_{j} - b_{j})^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span> is the covariance of allele frequency differences between two pairs of populations, and at the same time the sum of four f2-statistics: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
f_4(A, B; C, D) &amp;= \frac{1}{M}\sum_{j=1}^M(a_{j} - b_{j})(c_{j} - d_{j}) \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(f_2(A, D) + f_2(B, C) - f_2(A, C) - f_2(B, D) )
\label{eq:f42}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span> is the covariance of allele frequency differences between two pairs of populations where one population is the same on both sides. <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span> is thus a special case of <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>, and can also be written as a sum of <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
f_3(A; B, C) &amp;= f_4(A, B; A, C) \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2} (f_2(A, B) + f_2(A, C) - f_2(B, C))
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>In practice, the estimation of f-statistics can be more complicated, as it needs to account for low sample counts, missing data, and differences in ploidy, as described <a href="fstats.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>, f2-statistics are the foundation for all further analyses. They can be computed from genotype data and saved to disk with this command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1">prefix =<span class="st"> '/path/to/geno'</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" data-line-number="2">my_f2_dir =<span class="st"> '/store/f2data/here/'</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" data-line-number="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2</a></span>(prefix, my_f2_dir)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This will look for genotype files in <em>packedancestrymap</em> or <em>PLINK</em> format, compute allele frequencies and blocked <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics for all pairs of populations defined in the <code>.ind</code> or <code>.fam</code> file, and write them to <code>my_f2_dir</code>. It is also possible to extract only a subset of the samples or populations by passing IDs to the <code>inds</code> and <code>pops</code> arguments in <code><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2()</a></code>. To get a description of the arguemnts and to see examples of how to use it, type</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" data-line-number="1">?extract_f2</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Once finished, <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics for the populations of interest can be loaded like this.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-1" data-line-number="1">f2_blocks =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/f2_from_precomp.html">f2_from_precomp</a></span>(my_f2_dir)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Or you can load only a subset of the populations:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1" data-line-number="1">mypops =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span>(<span class="st">'Denisova.DG'</span>, <span class="st">'Altai_Neanderthal.DG'</span>, <span class="st">'Vindija.DG'</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-2" data-line-number="2">f2_blocks =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/f2_from_precomp.html">f2_from_precomp</a></span>(my_f2_dir, <span class="dt">pops =</span> mypops)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>If your data is so small that computing <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics doesnâ€™t take very long, you can also skip writing the data to disk and get the data in one step, by not providing an <code>outdir</code> argument:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-1" data-line-number="1">f2_blocks =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/extract_f2.html">extract_f2</a></span>(my_f2_dir, <span class="dt">pops =</span> mypops)</a></code></pre></div>
<p><code>f2_blocks</code> is now a 3d-array with <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics for each population pair along dimensions 1 and 2, and each SNP block along the 3rd dimension.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/dim.html">dim</a></span>(f2_blocks)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1]   7   7 708</code></pre>
<p>The purpose of having separate estimates for each SNP block is to compute jackknife or bootstrap standard errors for any <em>f</em>-statistic, and for any other estimated parameter.</p>
<p><code>f2_blocks</code> can be used like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-1" data-line-number="1">f2_blocks[,,<span class="dv">1</span>]                <span class="co"># f2-statistics of the 1st SNP block</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/apply.html">apply</a></span>(f2_blocks, <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="dv">2</span>, mean)   <span class="co"># average across all blocks</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-3" data-line-number="3">f2_blocks[pop1, pop2, ]       <span class="co"># f2(pop1, pop2) for all blocks</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The names along the 3rd dimension contain the SNP block lengths:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-1" data-line-number="1">block_lengths =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">parse_number</span>(<span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/dimnames.html">dimnames</a></span>(f2_blocks)[[<span class="dv">3</span>]])</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/head.html">head</a></span>(block_lengths)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 424 772 795 835 574 842</code></pre>
<p>If you want to try any of this without extracting and loading your own <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics, you can instead use <code>example_f2_blocks</code> which becomes available as you load <code>admixtools</code>.</p>

<p>The differences between <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>-statistics and <em>D</em>-statistics are usually negligible.

<a href="#qpwave-and-qpadm" class="anchor"></a><em>qpWave</em> and <em>qpAdm</em>
</h2>
<p><em>qpWave</em> and <em>qpAdm</em> are two programs with diffent goals - <em>qpWave</em> is used for estimating the number of admixture events, and <em>qpAdm</em> is used for estimating admixture weights - but they perform almost the same computations. The key difference is that <em>qpWave</em> compares two sets of populations (<code>left</code> and <code>right</code>), while <em>qpAdm</em> is tests how a single <code>target</code> population (which can be one of the <code>left</code> populations) relates to <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>. In <em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em>, both <code><a href="../reference/qpadm.html">qpadm()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/qpwave.html">qpwave()</a></code>require at least three arguments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistics</li>
<li>A set of left populations</li>
<li>A set of right populations</li>
</ol>
<p><code><a href="../reference/qpadm.html">qpadm()</a></code> additionally requires a <code>target</code> population as the 4th argument, which will be modelled as a mixture of <code>left</code> populations.</p>

<li>A two column matrix or data frame, where each row is an edge, the first column is the source of the edge, and the second column is the target. Additional columns labelled <code>lower</code> and <code>upper</code> can be used to constrain certain edges (<code>NA</code> = no constraint).</li>
<li>The location of a <em>qpGraph</em> graph file, which will be read and parsed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The leaf nodes of this graph have to match the <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>-statistic population labels, and the graph has to be a valid admixture graph: a directed acyclic graph where each node has no more than two parents.

<p><em>ADMIXTOOLS 2</em> can automatically find well-fitting graphs, and it has several functions for exploring the topological neighborhood of a graph. These functions are described <a href="graphs.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>To get a better theoretical understanding of <em>f</em>-statistics and admixture graphs, I recommend <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1755-0998.13230">this paper</a>.</p>
