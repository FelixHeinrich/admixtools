Description: admixtools is a set of methods used to infer demographic history from genetic data using f-statistics.
  It was originally implemented as a command line program in C. This is a new implementation of the programs
  qpDstat, qpAdm, qpGraph, and contains several new features.
  It is efficient because it precomputes f2-statistics which can be re-used for many analyses.
