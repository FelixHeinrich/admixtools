Description: AdmixTools is a set of methods used to infer demographic history from genetic data using f-statistics.
  It was originally implemented in C. This is a new implementation of some of the original methods.
  It is efficient because it precomputes precursors to f-statistics, which can be re-used for many analyses,
  making it necessary to read the genotype data only once.
